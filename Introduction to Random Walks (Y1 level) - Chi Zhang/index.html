                    The random walk is one of the most fundamental and far-reaching kinds of stochastic processes. The stochastic process is a fancy word for the random process, which is essentially the time evolution of a random variable <span class="mathJaxInline">$X$</span> (denoted as <span class="mathJaxInline">$X(t)$</span>).<a href='#cite1'>[1]</a> For example, the fluctuation of tomato prices in Tesco is a stochastic process, so is the variation of prices on the stock exchange, or the time evolution of Lagrangian data from the oceans.<a href='#cite2'>[2]</a> Nearly everything we measure over time is a stochastic process<span class="mathJaxInline">$^{*}$</span>, and therefore it is important for physicists to understand what they are and how we should work with them. This visualisation focuses on the time evolution of a random variable (usually position) on some mathematical space (usually <span class="mathJaxInline">$\mathbb{Z}^n$</span>), the random walk. By the end of this visualisation, the user should take away some introductory level of knowledge and appreciation for the random walk object, as well as how it is now being applied in many physical fields.

                    This graph describes one of the most basic types of the random walk - the Bernoulli process (named after Jacob Bernoulli, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bernoulli' target="_blank">the elder brother</a>). Consider a coin flip trial. When the coin lands on heads, the object moves forward by 1 increment; when the coin lands of tails, it moves backwards by 1 increment. In the jargon of statistics this is essentially a random walk on the integer number line. The Bernoulli process in its more general form (in which the mathematical space becomes two-dimensional and continuous and the time domain becomes continuous, while the step size follow a normal distribution that gets broader over time instead of being fixed) is often used to describe particle motion in a fluid. This is known as the Brownian motion.<a href='#cite3'>[3]</a>

                    This is perhaps the random walk<span class="mathJaxInline">$^{*}$</span> model that physicists use (and overuse) the most. While the walk was discovered by the English botanist Robert Brown as early as in 1827<a href='#cite4'>[4]</a>, a good enough mathematical model (for this seemingly erratic motion) did not come along until a certain Swiss patent clerk named Albert Einstein took a crack at it. In his 1905 paper "Investigations on the Theory of Brownian Movements"<a href='#cite3'>[3]</a>, Einstein proposed that the random motion of large particles in fluids is due to the thermal motion of molecules, and worked out the probability density function of the position of a single particle to be:

                    <span class="mathJaxDisplay">
                        $$f(x,t) = \frac{n}{\sqrt{4\pi D t}} \exp(-\frac{x^2}{4Dt})$$
                    </span>

                    where <span class="mathJaxInline">$n$</span> is the number of suspended particles in the fluid, <span class="mathJaxInline">$D$</span> the coefficient of diffusion, <span class="mathJaxInline">$t$</span> the time after a certain measurement of <span class="mathJaxInline">$x$</span> has been made. As can be seen from the equation, the position of the particle follows a normal distribution with its standard deviation increasing with <span class="mathJaxInline">$O(\sqrt{t})$</span>. By substituting t with and infinitesimal division of time <span class="mathJaxInline">$\delta t$</span>, we know that after discretising the time domain of the Brownian motion<span class="mathJaxInline">$^{\dagger}$</span>, the width of the flight for each individual steps also follow a normal distribution. We utilised this idea to build the visualisation of Brownian motion on the right.

                    This is a visualisation of the Brownian motion. In our simulation, because we can only do calculations for discretised time domain, the individual time steps is fixed by our program and chosen to be as small as computationally efficient. The slider below allows you to twerk the standard deviation of the probability density function. Try thinking of it as twerking the coefficient of diffusion of the fluid, which depends of external conditions such as temperature, viscosity, pressure, etc.

                            <li><span class="mathJaxInline">$^{*}$</span>Strictly speaking Brownian motion, due to its continuous nature, cannot be considered a random walk process. A random walk object must be discrete in both space and time. However, due to the fact that modern physicists usually use computer programmes to build their models, which require discretisation on the temporal and spatial domains, the concensus has become less strict and it is not uncommon for physicists and scientists in general to refer to the discretised version of Brownian motion as Brownian motion itself. <a href='#cite5'>[5]</a></li>

                    While Brownian motion is famous for its versatility (it can be used in thermodynamics to model suspended particle motion in a fluid, in quantum mechanics to form the theoretical basis of the path integral (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman%E2%80%93Kac_formula' target='_blank'>Feynman-Kac formula</a>), and in mathematical theory of finance to model pricing fluctuations over time (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model' target='_blank'>Black-Scholes model</a>)), it is only a special case of the more general Lévy process.

                    </ol>

                    While Condition 1 is a trivial initial condition, Condition 2 is a constraint necessary to ensure the motion is a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain' target='_blank'>Markov (or memoryless) process</a>, and Condition 4 states that there must not be any jumps or gaps in the time evolution of the probability density function, Condition 3 contains the most information as it restricts our pdf's of choice to that of a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_distribution' target='_blank'>stable distributions</a>, i.e. distributions which retain its properties under linear combination with a member of its own family.\(^{*}\)<a href='#cite1'>[1]</a> 
                    <br><br>

                    In this page we will be focusing on a specific construct of the Lévy process called the Lévy flight, which was first introduced by the French-American mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in his 1982 book "The Fractal Geometry of Nature".<a href='#cite6'>[6]</a> In this book, Mandelbrot proposed the Lévy walk object as a candidate model for galaxy clusters, and he used an isotropic walk with a Pareto step-width distribution defined as follows:

                    <span class="mathJaxDisplay">
                        $$f(x) = \bigg\{^{0 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ x < 1}_{Dx^{-(D+1)} \ \ x \geqslant 1}$$
                    </span>

                    where <span class="mathJaxInline">$D$</span> is the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_dimension#Role_of_scaling' target='_blank'>fractal dimension</a> of the resultant random walk object (not to be confused with the coefficient of diffusion <span class="mathJaxInline">$D$</span>), and is restricted to take values <span class="mathJaxInline">$0 < D < 2$</span> to ensure the stability of the random variable. This choice of range is incidentally the same as the choice of range on the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_distribution' target='_blank'><span class="mathJaxInline">$\alpha$</span> parameter</a> of a distribution, which is what mathematically defines a stable distribution. The stability of a function is a whole other topic worthy of its own visualisation. In this visualisation We will gloss over it, and leave it as an open question for the most daring to ponder: what makes D the equivalent of <span class="mathJaxInline">$\alpha$</span> in this distribution? (hint: Gnedenko and Kolmogorov's generalised central limit theorem).
                    <br><br>

                    As can be seen from our model on the right, the Lévy flight object behaves completely differently from the Brownian motion. Compared to Brownian motion, the Lévy flight is more prone to take big jumps due to its power-like instead of exponential-like tail. This means that while it is not the most likely for a Lévy walker to take big steps, the probability of the walk object landing in the tail is not negligibly small. Hence, for the right choice of <span class="mathJaxInline">$D$</span> parameter, we can obtain a walk object clustered in little groups, with clear divisions amongst them. And the closer the value of <span class="mathJaxInline">$D$</span> is to 0, the more dramatic the big jumps are, and the more defined the divisions are. On the other hand, the user might be surprised to find that the closer the <span class="mathJaxInline">$D$</span> value is to 2, the more the walk object resembles the classic Brownian motion. This is again tied into the <span class="mathJaxInline">$\alpha$</span> parameter of distributions (the <span class="mathJaxInline">$\alpha$</span> parameter of a normal distribution is equal to 2).
                    <br><br>

                    While the Lévy flight certainly is a bizarre and curious object, it can actually be found quite often in the natural world. Many biologists have discovered that certain organisms under certain conditions follow the Lévy flight, prompting many to believe the Lévy flight foraging hypothesis, stating that "organisms adapt the Brownian motion when there is an abundance of food, and the Lévy flight when there is a scarcity of food".<a href='#cite7'>[7]</a> This hypothesis agrees with our intuition as when there is a scarcity of food, an efficient way of foraging is to hover around a region for some time, and then concluding there is no food in a region, rush to the next for the same foraging process. Theoretically it has been shown that the Lévy flight, indeed, yields maximum searching efficiency under certain circumstances.<a href='#cite8'>[8]</a> In physics, the Lévy flight can be found in diffusion at liquid-solid interfaces.<a href='#cite9'>[9]</a> In fact, Lévy flight might not be as alien as we think. It could have been one of the natural random walks that have always escaped our notice until recently. An intersting observation made by Mandelbrot states that the Lévy flight is the zeroset of a 3 dimensional Brownian motion. Incidentally, the first hitting time of a 1-D Brownian motion (topological dimension), also follows the Lévy distribution.<a href='#cite10'>[10]</a>
